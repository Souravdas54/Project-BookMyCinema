Movie Ticket Booking System (project titled BookMyCinema) is a full-stack MERN application designed to provide a smooth and user-friendly movie ticket booking experience. Users can explore movies, view theater-wise showtimes, select seats through an interactive real-time seat layout, and complete bookings with secure online payments.

The system includes a powerful Admin Panel for managing movies, theaters, screens, showtimes, and bookings. With real-time seat validation, JWT-based authentication, Socket.io-based live chat, and a clean modular architecture, this project delivers a complete end-to-end ticketing solution ideal for learning, portfolio showcasing, and production-level implementation.
